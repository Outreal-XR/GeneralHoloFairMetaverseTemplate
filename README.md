# HoloFair SDK with Template
Get Started Unity3D project to create, configure, build and deploy HoloFair compatible interactive worlds.

## Requirements
- Unity3D 2020.3.3f1 (only)
- Windows and WebGL build support (iOS and Android are up to you)

## Important Notes
Feel free to change Addressables Profiles to any end point of your CDN. As long as it has [BuildTarget] in the URL (e.g https://cdn.holofair.app/addressables/[BuildTarget]).
At the same time, it is not reccomended to change any Player or Graphics settings as well as Packages and their versions. In case if you want to suggest an alternative setup or an addition, please, post on a issue with your idea, which we will read and try our best to make it work with HoloFair. Otherwise, if any changes made to the settings, then we can't gurantee that Addressables will load correctly or look the same as on your machine.
